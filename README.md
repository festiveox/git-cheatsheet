## **MAKE CHANGES**

Unstages the file, but preserve its contents

$ git diff

Shows file differences not yet staged

$ git diff --staged

Shows file differences between staging and the last file version

$ git commit -m "[descriptive message]"

Records file snapshots permanently in version history

## **GROUP CHANGES**

Name a series of commits and combine completed efforts
